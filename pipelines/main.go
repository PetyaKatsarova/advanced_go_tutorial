/*
Fan-out, fan-in
Multiple functions can read from the same channel until that channel is closed; this is called fan-out. This provides a way to distribute work amongst a group
 of workers to parallelize CPU use and I/O. A function can read from multiple inputs and proceed until all are closed by multiplexing the input channels onto
  a single channel thatâ€™s closed when all the inputs are closed. This is called fan-in. We can change our pipeline to run two instances of sq, each 
  reading from the same input channel. We introduce a new function, merge, to fan in the results:

/*
 if a stage fails to consume all the inbound values, the goroutines attempting to send those values will block indefinitely:: a resource leak: goroutines consume memory and runtime resources, and heap references in goroutine stacks keep data from being garbage collected.
 Goroutines are not garbage collected; they must exit on their own.
