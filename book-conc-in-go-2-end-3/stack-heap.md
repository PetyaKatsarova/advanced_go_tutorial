In Go, as in many programming languages, memory management is a fundamental concept, and understanding the distinction between the stack and the heap is crucial. Both are areas of memory used to store data, but they are managed differently and serve different purposes.

Stack
Definition: The stack is a region of memory that stores data in a last-in, first-out manner. It's highly efficient because of the way it accesses memory: adding or removing data only happens at the top of the stack.

Usage in Go: Go uses the stack for storing function call details (like local variables and return addresses) and for passing arguments between functions. Each goroutine in Go has its own stack, and the size of a stack starts small and grows as needed, up to a limit.

Characteristics:

Speed: Stack allocation and deallocation are very fast because they involve only moving the stack pointer.
Scope and Lifetime: Variables on the stack exist only within the scope of the function. When the function exits, the space allocated for its variables on the stack is reclaimed.
Size Limitation: Stack size is limited (often to a few MB per goroutine), and stack overflow can occur if this limit is exceeded (e.g., with deep recursion).
Heap
Definition: The heap is a larger pool of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. Unlike the stack, there's no enforced pattern to allocate or deallocate blocks, making it more flexible but also more complex.

Usage in Go: Objects whose size cannot be determined at compile-time, or that have a lifetime beyond the scope of the function executing, are allocated on the heap. This includes complex structures like slices, maps, and channels, as well as any variable whose memory is allocated with new or make, or when a pointer to a local variable is returned from a function.

Characteristics:

Flexibility: The heap can grow as needed (limited by the system's memory), making it suitable for allocating large or variable-sized data structures.
Lifetime: Memory on the heap persists until it's no longer referenced and is then
